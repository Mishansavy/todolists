"Remo is a to-do list app that I built using ReactJS for the frontend and Django for the backend. This was my first project where I got to combine my frontend and backend skills.
I started this project when I was learning ReactJS. As I got more comfortable with it, I kept adding new features and techniques. When I began learning about backend development, I decided to incorporate that knowledge into this project.
If you’re interested in understanding how the frontend and backend interact and how data is exchanged between them, feel free to check out this project. It’s a great starting point for anyone new to these concepts."
